\f0\fs24 \cf0 Inside of the JSON object are the individual objects for the first layer of skills. This had attributes for its title, logic (a string), and \'91columns\'92. Inside the first index of the columns is where the next layer of tags or a sub skill could be. In a tag object there is a file path string and title for each tag. The logic is intended to show whether the members of a skill would need to all be completed, or if just one would need to be completed to show knowledge of the skill. In the image file also in this folder there is a visual showing the connection from KSA to the object. }
